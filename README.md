# infra
This is a coordination project to keep the information organized, while searching for a better software production line and an infrastructure.



## Table of Contents 

> The following subjects will be studied

- [ci-cd](#ci-cd)
- [infrastructure](#infrastructure)
- [optimization](#optimization)
- [security](#security)

## Directory structure

All the sections listed above will have the same common directory structure :
- **src :** This directory contains source codes for the research title
- **doc :** This directory contains only the documents written by this equipe , for any other document found in the internet, it is sufficient to write down the URL into the file references.md
- **doc/references.md :** This file contains the document URLS found in the internet.
- **script:** This directory contains the scripts written to install, configura or any other purposes about the research title.
- **etc:** This directory contains the configuration files
